        <h1 class="title">Bubble Sort</h1>
        <p class="main-description">
          Bubble Sort is overall the simplest and most straightforward sorting algorithm. 
          It uses a brute force technique that checks every element against its neighbor, 
          swapping them if they are out of order. The algorithm iterates through the array until 
          it is sorted. It is a comparison sort, and is named for how elements will 
          bubble to the top or bottom. It is also generally the least efficient sorting algorithm 
          in terms of time complexity.

        <h1 class="title">Merge Sort</h1>
        <p class="main-description">
          Merge Sort is a more complex and efficient sorting algorithm. It works 
          by a divide and conquer method which breaks the larger list into <i>n</i>
          sublists, and sorts those separately. The algorithm then merges theses sublists
          into larger ones and separates those separately until the list is finally sorted. 
          Invented by John von Neumann in 1945, this divide and conquer algorithm is named for 
          the process of merging smaller sublists during the sorting process. It boasts a rather efficient
          time complexity and is generally implemented recursively.

        <h1 class="title">Quick Sort</h1>
        <p class="main-description">
          Quick Sort is a very efficient divide and conquer sorting algorithm that is also 
          commonly referred to as partition-exchange sort. It was developed by
          Tony Hoare in 1959, and works by sorting sublists depending on their relation to the "pivot" element. 
          The algorithm, which is a comparison sort that is commonly implemented recursively, has the 
          potential of outperforming other popular sorting algorithms by two to three times.
